So, you would like to contribute something to FunctionalPlus?
That is very nice to hear. Contributions are always welcome.

Let's say you have an idea for a new useful function you would like to [add](https://github.com/Dobiasd/FunctionalPlus/pulls).
The small example of `without` can already show a lot of things.

```c++
// API search type: without : (a, [a]) -> [a]
// fwd bind count: 1
// without(0, [1, 0, 0, 5, 3, 0, 1]) == [1, 5, 3, 1]
template <typename Container,
    typename T = typename Container::value_type>
Container without(T elem, const Container& xs)
{
    return drop_if(is_equal_to(elem), xs);
}
```

The function resides in `./include/fplus/filter.hpp`, because, well, it is some kind of filter. ;)

The coding style (what is lower/upper case, spaced instead of tabs, etc.) becomes apparent by just looking at the current code. Lines should not exceed 80 characters.

Every public exposed function (so everything not in `namespace internal`) should have an `API search type`. So the `./api_search/compile_all_and_deploy.sh` (I will run this after merging your pull request) can parse the type and show it on the [website](http://www.editgym.com/fplus-api-search/).

If it makes sense to have a partially curried version of your function in `namespace fwd` for forward application and composition (data parameter as the last one), you should specify a `fwd bind count`. If your functions type is `foo : (a, b, c) -> d` the `generate/generate_fwd_defines.sh` will insert a derived function `fwd::foo : (a, b) -> (c -> d)` into `./include/fplus/fwd_instances.autogenerated_defines`.

A few unit tests would also be nice. Here they belong into `./test/filter_test.cpp`

```c++
TEST_CASE("filter_test, without")
{
    using namespace fplus;
    typedef std::vector<int> Ints;
    REQUIRE_EQ(without(1, Ints({1,2,3})), Ints({2,3}));
    REQUIRE_EQ(without(5, Ints({1,2,3})), Ints({1,2,3}));
    REQUIRE_EQ(without(5, Ints({})), Ints({}));
}
```

Try to also cover corner cases you can think of.
